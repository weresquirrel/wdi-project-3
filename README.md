# Bring It!
[![Heroku App Status](https://heroku-shields.herokuapp.com/stark-garden-88296)](https://stark-garden-88296.herokuapp.com/)

An application that helps people organising who will bring what to a party - food, drinks, charcoal for BBQ, etc.

It was our third project at General Assembly's WDI course as a group assignment.

## Experience / Challenges Faced

We focused on learning how to collaborate, using Git & GitHub together and was pair-programming a lot.

It was also our first encounter with JavaScript frameworks, 3rd party Web APIs and writing proper tests.

Technical challenges:
- AngularJS
- Git branching/merging
- map integration
- testing

## Future plans / roadmap

- Allow users to update their profile
- Allow deletion of events
- Add picture albums for individual events (to upload after the party)
- Let users mark others as 'friends'
- Show on the map markets and shops nearby to the event
